Fraud Detection & Unauthorized Transaction Monitoring System
Overview

The Fraud Detection & Unauthorized Transaction Monitoring System is a SQL Server-based database project designed to manage financial transactions and support the identification, monitoring, and investigation of potentially fraudulent activities.

The system organizes users, accounts, merchants, devices, locations, transactions, fraud cases, alerts, and investigation activities into a relational database structure.

Key Objectives
Store and manage customer and account information.
Record and monitor financial transactions.
Track merchants, devices, and transaction locations.
Maintain different fraud types and their detection criteria.
Create and manage fraud cases.
Generate alerts for suspicious activities.
Assign fraud cases to investigators.
Maintain an audit log of system activities.
Support investigation and resolution of fraudulent transactions.
Database Components

The database contains 12 relational tables:

Users
Accounts
Merchants
Devices
Locations
Fraud_Types
Transactions
Fraud_Cases
Alerts
Investigators
Case_Assignments
Audit_Log
Fraud Monitoring

The database supports fraud monitoring through information such as:

Merchant risk scores
Location risk levels
Trusted device status
Fraud severity levels
Fraud confidence scores
Fraud detection thresholds
Transaction information
Fraud case status
Investigation priority
Audit records
Technology
Database: Microsoft SQL Server
Language: SQL
Database Design: Relational Database
Primary Keys: Used to uniquely identify records
Foreign Keys: Used to establish relationships between tables
Database Relationships

The system uses foreign-key relationships to connect users with their accounts and devices, transactions with users, accounts, merchants, devices and locations, and fraud cases with transactions and fraud types.

Fraud cases can subsequently be connected with alerts and assigned to investigators through the case assignment system.

Project Purpose

The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for a real-world financial security scenario. It focuses on organizing transaction data and supporting fraud detection, alert management, investigation, and auditing processes.
